Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict cardiovascular diseases by analyzing key health factors, including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes status, and lifestyle choices. 
Unlike traditional diagnostic methods, which are often time-consuming and subject to human error, ML provides a rapid and accurate, data-driven approach for disease prediction.

The study evaluates three powerful ML algorithms — Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Histogram Gradient Boosting (HGB) — to assess their strengths and limitations in predicting heart disease.

. SVM excels in identifying risk factors within smaller, structured datasets and effectively finds patterns of heart disease.

. ANN, with its deep learning capabilities, can uncover intricate relationships within large datasets, including medical imaging data, making it highly effective for complex tasks.

. HGB offers remarkable accuracy and efficiency, outperforming SVM in terms of speed while maintaining strong predictive power, particularly with diverse and large datasets.

This repository contains the implementation of these models, a performance comparison across different algorithms, and insights on optimizing ML techniques for accurate heart disease prediction.
